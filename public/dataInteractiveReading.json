Magnet fishers often work from a bridge or boat to see what they can discover. The thrill is the surprise factor.

This is because old pieces of scrap metal can be sold to recyclers to convert into new products. But perhaps the best part is knowing magnet fishing helps people connect with nature in a different way."
